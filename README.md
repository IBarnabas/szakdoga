# TURISZTIKAI SÉTÁT KIEGÉSZÍTŐ ALKALMAZÁS KÉSZÍTÉSE FLUTTER KERETRENDSZERREL

When designing a mobile application, there is always the question of which 
platform it should be developed for. Nowadays, the two most popular are iOS and 
Android. Both have a similar market share, so it is necessary to develop the application 
for both platforms. However, building the same application twice can be very expensive.
The cross-platform technology provides a solution to this problem. By using it, you can 
develop from a common code base to several platforms at the same time.

As part of my thesis, I created a Flutter application that can be run on Android and 
iOS systems. The application was created for a tourist walk. In the application, you can 
navigate between the stations of the walk. Furthermore, the mobile app implements art 
supplements (for example playing audios). I also created a backend, for which I used
Firebase applications.

In my thesis, I first present the Flutter framework and Firebase services.
Afterwards, I show the completed mobile application and then I describe how I 
implemented data access, user authentication, state management, map navigation, and the 
other technologies I used during the creation of the application
